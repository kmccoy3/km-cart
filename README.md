Personal Implementation of the CART Algorithm in Python

This repository is a collection of python scripts, functions, and classes I used to build my own version of the CART decision tree algorithm in python. Having written it in python, the code is very slow. However, writing in python made it very easy for me to test my own splitting functions that were not available in the `sklearn` or `rpart` implementation.

This repository is not finished, nor will it be any time soon, so read at your own risk. I am publishing it based on the small chance that someone may find my sandbox environment useful.
